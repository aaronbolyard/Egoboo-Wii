EGOBOO-WII

Egoboo-Wii is a port of the game Egoboo (http://egoboo.sourceforge.net)
to the Wii. In particular, it is rewritten for low memory usage and to
use the GX API provided by the Wii homebrew development kit, devkitPro.

There is not much to show except a lot of code that does very little
in the graphics department.

That is all.
